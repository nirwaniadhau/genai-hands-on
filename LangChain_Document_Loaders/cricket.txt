🏏 Poem on Cricket

Cricket is a game we all adore,
Bat and ball, and so much more.
The crowd cheers loud, the bowlers run,
Every match is full of fun.

A perfect shot, a mighty six,
Wickets fall in sudden tricks.
From every boundary, joy takes flight,
Cricket makes our hearts feel light.

We play with spirit, we play with pride,
With teamwork always by our side.
Win or lose, we still enjoy it,
Cricket is the game we love to play!
